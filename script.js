    // the results.  This would likely involve creating new HTML elements

    // pages.  The HTML structure and linking between pages would be
    // managed separately (e.g., using HTML anchor tags, server-side routing,
    // or a client-side routing library).

    // product data here.  This is just a conceptual example.
